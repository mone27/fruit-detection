# fruit-detection
this is a set of tools to detect and analyze fruit slices for a drying process.
For extracting the single fruit from the background here are two ways:
 - Open CV, simpler but requires manual tweaks of parameters for each different condition
 - U-Nets, much more powerfuls but still WIP
 
For fruit classification is uses a CNN.
